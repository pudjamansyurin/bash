Linux Client
========

## Download and Install

You can download and install the latest release from the official website at https://www.dev47apps.com/droidcam/linux/, along with instructions on how to update the webcam resolution and other info.

Releases are also available here on GitHub at https://github.com/dev47apps/droidcam/releases

Raspberry-PI instructions can be found here: https://github.com/dev47apps/droidcam/wiki/Raspberry-PI

## Building

Download and install latest libjpeg-turbo release via
https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases

The libjpeg-turbo package should go into `/opt/libjpeg-turbo`.
The official binaries (.deb, .rpm) will automatically install into the correct directory.

Install the following dependencies
(the package names are for Debian based systems, adjust as needed for other distros)
```
libavutil-dev
libswscale-dev
libasound2-dev
libspeex-dev
libusbmuxd-dev
libplist-dev

gtk+-3.0               # Only needed for GUI client
libappindicator3-dev   # Only needed for GUI client**

```
** Debian Bullseye has removed libappindicator. You can [download it manually](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/4761#issuecomment-778144713).


Run `make`, or `make droidcam-cli` if you skipped installing GTK+, to build the droidcam binaries.

To install, run `sudo ./install-client`.

## V4L2 Loopback (Webcam driver)

DroidCam comes with its own version of v4l2loopback, v4l2loopback-dc, which makes the app
[a little more user-friendly](https://github.com/dev47apps/droidcam/issues/56#issuecomment-626795824).

The client works with the standard [v4l2loopback-dkms](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) module,
and installing v4l2loopback-dc is optional. [v4l2loopback usage examples](https://github.com/dev47apps/droidcam/releases/tag/v1.7).

The standard v4l2loopback module is already available on most distros.

To install v4l2loopback-dc, make sure you have these dependencies installed
```
linux-headers-`uname -r` gcc make
```
then run `sudo ./install-video`.

Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL (Fedora/SUSE) based distros:

[If your system supports DKMS](./README-DKMS.md), you can instead use `sudo ./install-dkms`.

## Sound

Run `sudo ./install-sound` to load the Linux ALSA Loopback sound card which the Droidcam client will use for audio input.

To get the mic to show up in PulseAudio you can either run `pacmd load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:Loopback,1,0` (you may need to adjust the last number),
or by editing /etc/pulse/default.pa [as described here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Microphone).
On some systems you need to do this after launching the droidcam client.

To use DroidCam with Pipewire ([Source](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/713))
* Open pavucontrol, Configuration tab
* There's probably multiple devices called "Built-in Audio", one of them is droidcam. Try with the bottom device maybe.
* Choose the profile Pro Audio
* Go to the Input Devices tab
* Check which VU meter reacts to the phone's audio input (eg. Built-in Audio Pro 1), this is the desired audio input device.
* Inside pavucontrol you can now set this device as default input or choose it as the input device for individual apps etc.
